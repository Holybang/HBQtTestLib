HBQtTestLib
===========

Initial codes are from http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qtestlib-tools. There are some bugs when I try to build this project in QtCreator (with Qt 5). So I fix some bugs to make it pass the build. Currently, we can use "generatereport results.xml" to generate graphs demonstrating the test results in some html files.

At least, the graphs are nice.
